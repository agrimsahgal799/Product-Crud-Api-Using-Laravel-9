## About This API

This is the product crud API, where we can create products with variations. Apis is available to manage variation options, values, and variation sets. So if you want to create the product through the API, you need to create an option set that will be selected during product creation. Please follow these steps to create variations and products:

- Create variation options by using these API: {{base_url}}/api/option/save
- Get variation options by using these API: {{base_url}}/api/options
- Delete variation options by using these API: {{base_url}}/api/option/delete


- Create option values by using these API: {{base_url}}/api/option/value/save
- Get option values by using these API: {{base_url}}/api/option_values
- Delete option value by using these API: {{base_url}}/api/option/value/delete
